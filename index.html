        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>We are a company based off of an author by the name of Ray Bradbury and one of his books called “There Will
            Come Soft Rains,” which was based on a small poem by the same name, and Ray Bradbury just took that small poem
            and made a much larger poem off of it, and we have made a house based off of that in the book.</p>
