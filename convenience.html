        <p>As you may notice, the kitchen is shown above, and you may be wondering why. Well, the reason why is
            because the cleaning is mainly done in the kitchen, as that gets the dirtiest in any house; however,
            these cleaning technologies can also be used anywhere else in the house. Here are a few different things
            that The Smart House&#8482; has to keep itself clean: an automatic dishwasher, robot mice to clean up the dirt in
            the house and dust, and an incinerator to get rid of things that you don't want anymore. (I.E., trash) and
            copper scrap rats to take the larger trash to the incinerator.</p>
        <p>There are also some convenience things to make your living experience more enjoyable and easy in The Smart
            House™.
            Those convenience items are: a voice clock to wake you up in the morning, set a schedule for you, give you
            reminders, and do other things that a normal clock can do; a stove to make you breakfast; a weather box to let
            you know of the weather and tell you it's conditions; automatic garage doors; patio tables to set up games,
            drinks, food, and music; automatic bed warmers that warm according to the temperature; automatic baths to
            start if you ask them to; and automatic garden sprinklers that turn on to keep the garden looking fresh and
            clean so that way you don't have to.</p>

        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>We are a company based off of an author by the name of Ray Bradbury and one of his books called “There Will
            Come Soft Rains,” which was based on a small poem by the same name, and Ray Bradbury just took that small poem
            and made a much larger poem off of it, and we have made a house based off of that in the book.</p>
