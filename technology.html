            <p>Window Shudders can scare away any unwanted animals like deer, rats, snakes, or other animals like bears
                even. You have the option to choose between window shutters or just window curtains. Continue down the
                page to see the difference.</p>

            <h2>Door/Window Curtains</h2>
            <p>The door/window curtains were mainly meant for the doors, but they can also go on the windows, as you can
                see in the picture. As stated previously, you have the option to choose between the window shudders or
                the window curtains. We would recommend the window shudders as they give you more protection and privacy.

        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>We are a company based off of an author by the name of Ray Bradbury and one of his books called “There Will
            Come Soft Rains,” which was based on a small poem by the same name, and Ray Bradbury just took that small poem
            and made a much larger poem off of it, and we have made a house based off of that in the book.</p>
